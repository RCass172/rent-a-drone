# **Introduction**

Rent A Drone is a business website showcasing a photographers service of hiring his drone to capture professional photographs and videos for customers. The inspiration for the website came from a friend who had this business idea in mind and wanted me to bring it to life.

The primary goal is to show all relevant information to a user in an appealing way with an easy to use, responsive website. As the business owner is primarily on Instagram, I decided to embed a video from the Instagram account to encourage the user to connect via social media and increase brand awareness.

The website has been created using a simple design and use of JavaScript interactivity to avoid too much information being shown to the user all at once, which can make the page feel too busy. A responsive contact form is also provided to ensure users have a clear way to contact the business and all emails are sent directly to the business owner, which will in turn create bookings.
